# Tests

- Unit tests: place under `tests/unit` as `*.test.tsx?`.
- E2E tests: place under `tests/e2e` as `*.spec.ts` (Playwright).

Add frameworks as needed:
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests.
- Playwright for e2e.

Run:
- `npm test` (placeholder) until frameworks are installed.
- `npx playwright test` if Playwright is set up.
